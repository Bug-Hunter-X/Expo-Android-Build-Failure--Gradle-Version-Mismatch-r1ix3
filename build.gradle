This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK. It happens because the Android build process requires a specific version of Gradle, and if the wrong version is used, the build process fails with the following error message:  `A problem occurred configuring project ':app'. > Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':app:classpath'. > Could not download gradle-7.5.1-all.zip`, or similar.
